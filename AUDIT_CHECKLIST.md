# CampusSentry implementation audit

Baseline: the supplied archive contained a clean Git worktree at commit `f547761`. The initial `npm ci` attempt failed with a Windows `EPERM` directory-creation error. To review without a network install, the dependency tree already included in the supplied archive was restored. The repository did not include an existing test script or ESLint flat config; both were added. The pre-change scripts were therefore not fully runnable in this environment.

## Phase 1 — Functional correctness

| Finding | Severity | Area | Status and evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Repeated or contradictory request decisions were accepted. | High | `src/store/demo-store.ts`, `src/lib/workflow.ts`, `src/app/visitor-requests/page.tsx` | Fixed: only Pending Approval and Additional Information Required can be reviewed. Terminal requests show no decision controls. Covered by transition tests. |
| Keep Pending changed only the request and could leave linked records inconsistent. | High | `src/store/demo-store.ts` | Fixed: request, visitor, and notification states now update together; a review-history item and audit item are recorded. |
| Request Info and rejection could proceed with fallback text or empty notes. | High | `src/app/visitor-requests/page.tsx`, `src/components/shared/confirm-dialog.tsx`, `src/store/demo-store.ts` | Fixed: required in-app input, store-level non-empty guards, and stale dialog input resets. |
| Guest OTP was marked verified without a verification action. | High | `src/store/demo-store.ts`, `src/mocks/demo-data.ts`, `src/app/visitor-requests/page.tsx` | Fixed: configured external guests start Pending Verification; the explicit demo action moves them to Pending Approval and writes review/audit history. No SMS delivery is claimed. OTP policy has regression tests. |
| Manual visitor creation could appear approved and OTP-verified. | High | `src/app/visitor-records/page.tsx`, `src/store/demo-store.ts` | Fixed: the form creates a linked simulated request; a direct service-created record is also forced into a pending state and cannot be checked in. |
| Identity relationships could be inferred from names, including duplicate display names. | High | `src/store/demo-store.ts`, `src/components/shared/simulation-modal.tsx`, `src/app/identity-registry/page.tsx`, `src/types/index.ts` | Fixed: only a unique active demo registry name match is linked, all later relationships use stable record IDs, and ambiguous names remain unlinked. Covered by a regression test. |
| Editing visitor display details left linked request and notification copies stale. | Medium | `src/store/demo-store.ts` | Fixed: linked display projections update by `visitorId`; event history retains its captured display name. |
| Dashboard and analytics date controls changed selection without filtering their data; hourly charts fabricated bins. | High | `src/lib/workflow.ts`, `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/app/analytics/page.tsx` | Fixed: local Today/Week/Month periods filter the request and visitor populations; hourly charts use timestamped gate events and show empty states. Date/bin logic has regression tests. |
| Entry/exit Today counts used all-time totals, and non-approved visitors could be checked in through store actions. | High | `src/app/entry-exit/page.tsx`, `src/app/visitor-records/page.tsx`, `src/store/demo-store.ts` | Fixed: Today uses local day boundaries; store requires an approved request, prevents duplicate entry and invalid exit, and allows a new entry after a recorded exit. |
| Registry-only reset invoked a full demo reset. | Medium | `src/store/demo-store.ts`, `src/app/identity-registry/page.tsx` | Fixed: registry restore resets only the canonical five and records an audit item; full reset remains separately confirmed. |
| Native prompt/confirm interactions and dialog state/focus behavior were inconsistent. | Medium | `src/components/shared/confirm-dialog.tsx`, `src/components/shared/simulation-modal.tsx`, reset controls | Fixed: important confirmations use in-app dialogs, required inputs reset on open, Escape closes, focus is restored, and focus is trapped in the two shared dialogs. |
| Login ignored credentials and role selection did not change the demo user. | Medium | `src/app/login/page.tsx`, `src/store/demo-store.ts` | Fixed: login explicitly identifies itself as demo access, selected role changes the client-side user, and the UI states that credentials are not validated. |
| Configured categories, authorities, OTP, walk-in priority, and Unknown review flags were partly inert. | Medium | `src/app/settings/page.tsx`, `src/components/shared/simulation-modal.tsx`, `src/store/demo-store.ts` | Fixed: forms consume configured categories/authorities; OTP gates review; walk-in setting controls priority; Unknown flag creates a neutral review alert. Inert sound/desktop settings were removed. Retention is labelled as a target, not automatic deletion. |
| Persisted UI state and malformed localStorage could produce invalid state or stale dialogs. | Medium | `src/store/demo-store.ts` | Fixed: only domain state is persisted; arrays, user, settings, and scalar values are validated and merged with safe defaults; transient modal/search state is not restored. |
| README/UI claimed live sync, immutable audit, or verified hardware state for a frontend demo. | Medium | `README.md`, dashboard, audit, notifications, security, entry/exit copy | Fixed: simulated, browser-local, and non-tamper-proof boundaries are stated accurately. |

### Phase 1 checks

- [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` — passed after the workflow and state changes.
- [x] `npm test` — 5 tests passed; Node prints a non-failing module-type detection warning for the TypeScript test file.
- [x] `npm run lint -- --quiet` — passed with no errors. The normal lint invocation reports pre-existing unused-import warnings across the imported prototype pages.
- [x] `npm run build` — passed; Next.js compiled and statically generated all 14 routes.
- [ ] Browser interaction sweep — could not run: the in-app browser timed out on both `localhost:3000` and `127.0.0.1:3000`, and the shell was denied local socket access by the environment; production build succeeded, but live UI verification remains unconfirmed.

## Phase 2 — UI and accessibility

- [x] Added shared light/dark semantic CSS tokens and Dark class overrides used across all routes.
- [x] Added persisted Light / Dark / System preference, system-change handling, and early theme initialization.
- [x] Added reduced-motion handling and visible focus styles.
- [x] Added a horizontal mobile navigation for small screens; desktop sidebar remains available at medium widths and above.
- [x] Added responsive notification popover sizing and an accessible notification link target.
- [x] Added `.21st/design.json`, `.21st/DESIGN.md`, and `project-theme.css` as local design context/theme preparation.
- [ ] `21st review` / component search — not run: the 21st CLI was not installed and the attempted `npx` invocation did not complete in the restricted network environment.
- [ ] Publish theme — prepared only. Publishing is public and requires an explicit approval step under the requested design-sync workflow.
- [ ] Browser verification of all routes, themes, responsive breakpoints, and keyboard paths — blocked by local socket restrictions in the environment; no visual behavior is claimed as browser-verified.

## Deliberate scope exclusions

- No production backend, database, identity provider, real OTP gateway, live AI/biometrics, cross-device notification bus, or gate hardware integration was added.
- The separate Staff/Security Mobile App and Phase 3 production integrations were not added.
