# CampusSentry AI — Admin Web Application

Frontend-only campus visitor management prototype with a simulated meeting approval workflow and security monitoring views. It does not connect to live cameras, identity models, gates, SMS, or push notification services.

This repository contains the **Admin Web Application** for CampusSentry AI. Demo actions run in the browser through Zustand and localStorage. The separate Staff Mobile App and production backend are not included.

## 1. Project Workflow & Core Concept

1. **Visitor Arrival:** A visitor arrival is entered into the demo workflow.
2. **Staff Gate Capture:** The prototype simulates a security staff member recording visitor category, stated reason, meeting recipient, and timing.
3. **Admin Web Dispatch:** The demo action creates a linked request, visitor record, notification, and audit event in local state.
4. **Administrative Decision:** An administrator reviews the request (noting the critical distinction between *Who arrived*, *Identity classification*, and *Whom they want to meet*), approves/rejects with reasons, or requests more information.
5. **Gate Synchronization:** The request record changes locally. Production gate updates require a backend integration.

> **Crucial Workflow Distinction:** This is a **visitor-request and meeting-approval workflow**, not an administrator calendar or student meeting planner.

## 4. Key Data Model Distinctions

The application enforces clear domain boundaries:

| Concept | Definition | Permitted Values |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Visitor Category** | **WHO has arrived** at the campus gate | Student, Parent/Guardian, Guest/External Visitor, Teaching Staff, Non-Teaching Staff, Vendor, Other, Not specified |
| **Identity Classification** | **HOW the visitor's identity is classified** | Known, Unknown, Verification Required |
| **Person / Authority to Meet** | **WHOM the visitor seeks to meet** | Principal/Director, Dean/HOD, Administrator, Other Authority/Office |
| **Reason for Meeting** | **WHY the visitor wants a meeting** | Stated query, fee consultation, vendor delivery, etc. |
| **Visit Mode** | **WHEN the meeting is requested** | Walk-in (Immediate / Now) vs Scheduled (Date & Time) |

*Note: An **Unknown** classification does NOT mean the visitor is malicious, dangerous, or automatically denied access. An AI match never independently authorizes access.*

## 5. Seeded Known Identity Registry

As explicitly specified in the product specification, the Known Identity Registry is seeded with **exactly five canonical entries**:

1. **Keshav**
2. **Praveen**
3. **Raj**
4. **Aditi**
5. **Supriya**

No invented surnames, telephone numbers, student/employee IDs, or biometric files are fabricated. When an incoming request matches one of these names, it is tagged as a **&ldquo;Demo registry match&rdquo;** for administrative correlation.

**Reset Demo Data** restores the full seeded demo state. **Restore Registry Defaults** restores only these five identities.

## 6. How to Run & Test the Core Workflow

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 18 (Tested on v24.21.0)
- npm >= 9

### Installation & Run
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the configured checks
npm test
npm run lint
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run build

# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Start the production build
npm start
```

### Complete End-to-End Evaluation Journey:
1. Open the application at `http://localhost:3000` (or `/login`).
2. Observe the **Overview Dashboard** period-filtered request counts and current campus presence.
3. Click the top-banner button: **&ldquo;Simulate Incoming Staff Request&rdquo;**.
4. Test one of the quick presets (e.g. *Keshav - Seeded Known Guest*, *Nandini - Unknown Parent*, or *Raj - Seeded Known Vendor*), or enter custom fields.
5. Click **&ldquo;Dispatch Simulated Staff Request&rdquo;**. When guest OTP is required, the request remains in Pending Verification and does not claim delivery.
6. Observe:
   - The unread notification badge increments.
   - A new item appears in the Staff Notifications dropdown and page.
   - The pending review counter increments on the sidebar.
   - An audit trail item is appended.
7. Open **Visitor Requests** (or click the notification to navigate directly).
8. Inspect the visitor details in the review drawer.
9. For a guest, use **Simulate OTP Verification** to record the demo-only check, then Approve or Reject with a reason.
10. Verify that the request status, corresponding notification, visitor record, and overview KPIs reflect the local decision.
11. Navigate to **Visitor Records**:
    - Manually adjust an identity classification (Known, Unknown, Verification Required) with an in-app dialog.
    - Click **Record Gate Entry** or **Record Gate Exit** to update simulated campus presence. Check-in is only available for approved requests.
12. Click **Export CSV** on Visitor Requests, Records, or Audit Logs to verify RFC 4180 spreadsheet generation.
13. Click **Reset Demo Data** to confirm canonical state restoration.

## 7. Backend Integration Architecture & Contract

The frontend encapsulates all data interactions behind clean typed contracts in `src/services/api-client.ts`:
- `IVisitorRequestService`: Fetching, approving, rejecting, and simulating requests.
- `IVisitorRecordService`: Gate check-in, check-out, record archiving, and manual additions.
- `IIdentityRegistryService`: Classification adjustments and history logging.
- `INotificationService`: Push notification ingestion and read receipts.
- `ISecurityMonitoringService`: Incident tracking and sensor health polling.

### Production Migration Roadmap:
To connect to the actual backend when available:
1. Provide `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_GATEWAY_URL` in `.env.local`.
2. Replace mock methods in `src/services/api-client.ts` with authenticated `fetch()` calls containing JWT bearer tokens.
3. Replace the local simulation modal trigger with a WebSocket (`wss://`) or Server-Sent Events (SSE) listener subscribing to `/api/events/staff-requests`.

## 8. Simulated vs Production Scope Clarifications

- **Simulated in this Prototype:** Staff request submissions, OTP verification, recognition scores, security alerts, and gate events. The prototype sends no SMS and has no live sensor or turnstile connection.
- **Audit Trail:** Stored in editable browser state; it is not immutable or tamper-proof.
- **Theme:** Light, Dark, and System appearance preferences apply globally and persist in localStorage.
- **Strictly Frontend-Only:** Client-side role switching is provided for demo evaluation and must not be treated as a security boundary.
- **Production Server Authority:** Production authorization, password hashing, tamper-evident audit storage, and biometric inference must reside on backend infrastructure.
